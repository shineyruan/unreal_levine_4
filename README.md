# Levine Hall 4th Floor in UE4

Developed with Unreal Engine 4.23.1. This project holds a 3D model of Levine Hall 4th floor of SEAS building of University of Pennsylvania, created from Autodesk Revit 2019.

During gameplay, it also does the following:
- saves the 3D location of the active actor into `csv/actorLocation.csv` upon every mouse right click.
- sets up a communication between itself and ROS.

This project is standalone software and it can be launched by itself. However, it is designed to be one part of the [CAD2CAV project](https://github.com/mlab-upenn/ISP2021-cad2cav) of F1/10 Autnomous Racing Group of University of Pennsylvania.
